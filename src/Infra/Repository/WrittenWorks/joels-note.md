Brenta,

I think this is it. I know you can't really be out here anymore, but just in case you somehow are and you somehow find this message, I want you to know. I want you to know that I almost made it. I kept trying. But the land failed me. I'm moving on now. I've scavenged what I can, but it will only do me for so long. I've left you a tin of soup. It's minestrone, I think.

If you do find this, I'm going back to Douglas.

With love,
Joel
